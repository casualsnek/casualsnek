### Hello,

### I am :
A passionate Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) enthusiast hailing from Nepal. Operating under this pseudonym, I develop handy, free utilities and software, with a particular focus on enhancing the Linux user experience. Additionally, I dabble in the world of photography, capturing random moments from my phone and sharing them on my website.

During my leisure moments, you'll often find me strolling around, relishing a soothing cup of tea, and capturing some photograhs.
